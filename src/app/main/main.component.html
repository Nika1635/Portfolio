        <p>
          I'm Nika, a 16-year-old junior front-end developer with experience building web apps. 
          I specialize in integrating APIs, managing authentication and state, and crafting responsive UIs that work across devices.

        <p>
          I'm passionate about clean code, dynamic interfaces, and continuously leveling up my skills. 
          I've built multiple Angular and JS projects, including a live online shop, and I'm currently focused on expanding my portfolio and preparing for my first developer job.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy working on personal projects where train my knowledge.
