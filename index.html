            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I'm Nika, a 16-year-old junior front-end developer with experience building web apps. 
            I specialize in integrating APIs, managing authentication and state, and crafting responsive UIs that work across devices.
            </p>
            <p>
            I'm passionate about clean code, dynamic interfaces, and continuously leveling up my skills. 
            I've built multiple Angular and JS projects, including a live online shop, and I'm currently focused on expanding my portfolio and preparing for my first developer job.
            </p>
            <p>
            I enjoy working on personal projects where train my knowledge.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm also interested to learn React soon.
